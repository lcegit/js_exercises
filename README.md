##Javascript Exercises #1
**Basic stuff!***

1. Create an array and add three numbers to it.
2. Use your array to return the second number.
3. What data type is 123/12? "Things in quotes!"? undefined?
4. Write an if statement that returns true.
5. Consider these two arrays: myArray = ['Thomas', 'Amber', 'Raoul'] and emptyArray = []. Use a for loop to add our names to emptyArray. (Hint: n needs to be the length of the array. Google a helper method for finding the length of an array in Javascript. Is it the same as Ruby?)
